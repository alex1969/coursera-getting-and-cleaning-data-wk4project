# coursera-getting-and-cleaning-data-wk4project
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate one's ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.One will be graded by peers on a series of yes/no questions and will be required to submit: 1) a tidy data set, 2) a link to a Github repository with script for performing the analysis, and 3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. One must include a README.md in the repo as well. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.
